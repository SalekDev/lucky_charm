# Lucky Charm Mod

A simple mod that reworks loot generation in minecraft using the long-forgotten luck entity attribute
only previously used in fishing gameplay when using the luck of the sea enchantment. When having
luck, new probabilities for each entry in the loot pool are calculated when generating the loot. The
probabilities calculated will give on average better quality loot according to each entry's quality
value. See `.../mixin/loot/LootPoolMixin.java` for a detailed explanation.
